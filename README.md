JobBoard is an application to keep track of the myriad of positions applied to 
while searching for internships and new grad positions as I move on to graduate.  Helpful in making sure I don't apply to a company twice, as
well as keeping notes on my strength and weaknesses I've felt i've recognized throughout my interviews so I can better improve myself.

Feature:
* Status of application - The application is centered around keeping track of the applications.  To do this, applications can be sorted based on their status.
    * To Apply - For job postings that haven't been applied to yet, perhaps for needing additional information.
    * Applied - For positions that have been applied to.  Companies with applicant links to track their own status locally can be 
                saved within the "link" line
    * In Progress - For when you've had a followup to the intial application.
    * Offer - For postions you've gotten a job offer.
    * Rejected - For positions I've been officially rejected.
    * No Response - For Positons no response has been had after 3 weeks.

For personal use, currently the project need to be imported into QT Creator and compiled locally after altering the path of the sqlite database file on your local machine.
